Virtual Tourist

This is app that allows you to virtually tour any place on the planet. Simply drop a pin anywhere on the map, and instantly browse nearby Flickr photos. This was one of the capstone projects in my Udacity Nanodegree and it helped increase my understanding of the complexities of Core Data and how it can be used.
